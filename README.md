# FlappyBird

This JavaScript code contains the mechanics of the flappy bird game. The game includes a simple game engine that allows the character to jump over obstacles.

How does it work?

1. When the game starts, the character automatically starts moving upwards.

2. The user can make the character jump by calling the "jump" function.

3. As the obstacles pass through the screen, the hole at the top of the obstacles is also randomly repositioned.

4. The game checks whether the character hits obstacles and whether the character falls to the ground.

5. If the character hits obstacles or falls to the ground, the game is over and terminated with a notification.
